An example idea of Navigational patterns in SwiftUI, principally how can REST patterns be applied to iOS navigation in such a way that several problems are solved.

- Indirect navigations(a concrete way to navigate from one part of an app to another, that is multiple scenes away, in a typesafe manner)
- First class Deep Link support, path and param based navigation up front allows for externally exposed app architecture up front instead of as an after thought
- Application navigation persistence, want users to return to a spot in an app that may have been killed in the background? if you store a URL in the UserDefaults object you can restore off that on every app launch and thus have a sticky and engaged feeling.


More to come!
